> ðŸŽ„ Feliz Navidad, Buon Natale, Merry Christmas

## Description

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- Each solution in well contained in a folder with the following structure:

  ```
  ./<year>/day-<day>/part-<part>
  ```

  For instance: [./2023/day-01/part-01](./2023/day-01/part-01)

- Each solution folder contains the following files:

  - `main.cpp`: The solution code.
  - `input.txt`: The input data for the solution.
  - `output.txt`: The expected output for the solution.
  - `submit.txt`: The answer to submit to the Advent of Code website.
